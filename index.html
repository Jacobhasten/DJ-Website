    <p class="paragraph-1">
        Izzy of Sangoma Records is a New York City raised Psychedelic Trance DJ.
        After getting behind the decks in 2010, he quickly established a name
        for himself throughout the underground of NYC. His best known accomplishments
        outside of rocking dance-floors throughout the East Coast, Europe, Israel and
        other random shindigs in the US, were putting together top-chart
        hitting compilations, supporting some of the biggest acts
        in the global psytrance scene,
        and organizing a few squats of his own.

    <p class="paragraph-2">
        His fluency with all kinds of psychedelic electronic
        music keeps his reputation described in one word:
        Versatility. With a strong lust for keeping his crowd of neo hippies
        in constant suspense, his wild stage presence and spontaneous track selection remain dominant.
        He has two rules: no cheese and no plans.
