                Izzy of Sangoma Records is a New York City raised Psychedelic Trance DJ.
                After getting behind the decks in 2010, he quickly established a name
                for himself throughout the underground of NYC. His best known accomplishments
                outside of rocking dance-floors throughout the East Coast, Europe, Israel and
                other random shindigs in the US, were putting together top-chart
                hitting compilations, supporting some of the biggest acts
                in the global psytrance scene,
                and organizing a few squats of his own.</p>
            <p>His fluency with all kinds of psychedelic electronic
                music keeps his reputation described in one word:
                Versatility. With a strong lust for keeping his crowd of neo hippies
                in constant suspense, his wild stage presence and spontaneous track selection remain dominant.
                He has two rules: no cheese and no plans.</p>
